# CSE140_Proj
### CSE140: Computer Architecture's Project #1
#### Description: 
In this project, you will create an instruction interpreter for a subset of MIPS code. Starting with the assembled instructions in memory, you will fetch, disassemble, decode, and 
execute MIPS machine instructions, simulating each stage in the computation. You're 
creating what is effectively a miniature version of MARS! There is one important difference, 
thoughâ€”MARS takes in assembly language source files, not 
.dump files, so it contains an 
assembler, too.
